# Antibio-resistance
Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a species of Gram-negative bacteria and the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection Gonorrhoeae. With a steady rise in cases each year there is a corresponding rise in resistant strains. Antimicrobial resistance is becoming a serious concernâ€” currently antimicrobial resistant infections kill over 700,000 people per year. By 2050 its estimated 10 million people will die from of antimicrobial resistant infections.  The goal of this study is to identify the unitigs(sequences from complete bacterial genome) that most significantly contribute to a resistant phenotype in clinical isolates. The study attempts to answer-  Which cellular mechanisms/proteins in the bacteria contribute most to mutidrug resistance? Is the data generated consistent with available literature? What are the genes that consistently appear as responsible for resistance against different drugs and can we target their protiens?
